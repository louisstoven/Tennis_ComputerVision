# AI/ML Tennis Analysis System

## Overview
This repository contains an AI/ML Tennis Analysis System built using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, including YOLO (You Only Look Once), PyTorch, and key point extraction methods. The system is designed to analyze tennis matches, providing insights into player movements, shot detection, and match statistics. The project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial that introduced the foundational concepts and techniques utilized in this implementation.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are to:

Develop a robust computer vision system for analyzing tennis matches in real-time.
Utilize YOLO for object detection to identify players, balls, and other key elements in the game.
Implement PyTorch for deep learning tasks, enabling efficient model training and inference.
Extract key points to analyze player movements and techniques.
Provide comprehensive insights into player performance and match dynamics.

## Learning Resources
YouTube Tutorial: AI Tennis Analysis Tutorial - This video provided a foundational understanding of YOLO, PyTorch, and key point extraction techniques that informed this project.
